        <p class="hero-paragraph">  I'm a student at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a>, where I study <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/">Computer Science Engineering</a>.
            I am passionate about creating digital media, no matter what form it takes. My interests in development include
            designing responsive user interfaces, cryptography, and providing useful tools to make people's lives easier </p>

            <p> I've had a passion for film production
          and design since I was young.
          More recently I've worked as a project manager,
          and cinematographer for several
          South Florida based firms.
          I've been a 'main' camera for Cosmos Video for several years.
          My work can be found on their <a href="http://www.cosmosvid.com/"> website. </a>
            </p>

            <i class="fa fa-code"></i>
            <p>  Developing functional apps and programs is a dream.
          I am proficient in many programming langauges including:
          Java
          C++
          Swift
          MATLAB
          and many more technologies such as SQL,CSS,HTML.
          My work is currently being transfered over to my <a href="https://github.com/ppoplawska">GitHub Repo</a>

            <p> I enjoy DIY-Projects, and tinkering. I'm currently investigating the Arduino platform and
            am looking forward to building some small, but powerful systems in the near future. In particular I am
            interested in how these devices can be used to investigate the safety of enterpise networks.
