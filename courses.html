      <blockquote><p>This course provides an introduction to the real-world aspects of defending an enterprise network.
        Students will gain hands-on experience performing system administration tasks and handling incidents.
        The course begins with an overview of the components that constitute an enterprise network,
        continues with a study of risk identification and vulnerability management, and concludes with a look at real-world attacks and mitigations.

        Topics covered include enterprise architecture, network and endpoint security, incident management, vulnerability management, configuration management,
        policy, and other emerging topics.</p><footer>Nolen Scaife</footer></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>IThis course teaches students fundamental knowledge in Computer Architecture and Microarchitecture. The course covers the basic organizations of
          computer systems including instruction-set architecture, execution pipeline, memory hierarchy, and I/O subsystem.
          It also addresses advanced processor microarchitecture issues such as dynamic instruction scheduling, branch prediction,
          lock-up free caches, instruction-level parallelism, multiple instruction fetch/issuing, speculative execution, etc. to
          improve computer processor performance. Shared-memory multiprocessor systems with coherent caches to reduce memory access latency,
          the virtual machine concept and virtual machine monitor are also covered. Term projects will be assigned to study issues of high-performance processors.
